# Advent of Code 2021

I am trying to
 1. Write clear and accessible Haskell code
 2. Solve the problem
 3. See if I can learn more about how to use Haskell's laziness well

I am not trying to
 1. come up with the most efficient/clever solution
 2. Be number 1 on the global leaderboard

## Prerequsites
 * [The Haskell Tool Stack](https://haskellstack.org)

## Running
```
stack run [dayID[ dayID[ dayID]]] # dayID is day01, day02, etc.
```
